# Machine-Learning-Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis
Machine learning algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression are applied to breast cancer data. It evaluates the performance of each algorithm by measuring accuracy, precision, recall, Matthews correlation coefficient, and area under the ROC curve.
