# Machine-Learning-Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis
Machine learning algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression are applied to breast cancer data. It evaluates the performance of each algorithm by measuring accuracy, precision, recall, Matthews correlation coefficient, and area under the ROC curve.

For each algorithm:

Logistic Regression:

Fits a logistic regression model to the training data.
Predicts the target variable for the test data.
Calculates and prints the accuracy score.
Prints the classification report, including precision, recall, and other metrics.
Computes and prints the Matthews correlation coefficient.
Plots the ROC curve.
Nearest Neighbor:

Creates a K-nearest neighbor classifier.
Trains the classifier using the training data.
Predicts the target variable for the test data.
Calculates and prints the accuracy score.
Prints the classification report.
Computes and prints the Matthews correlation coefficient.
Plots the ROC curve.
Random Forest:

Constructs a random forest classifier with 500 trees.
Trains the classifier using the training data.
Predicts the target variable for the test data.
Calculates and prints the accuracy score.
Prints the classification report.
Computes and prints the Matthews correlation coefficient.
Plots the ROC curve.
SVM:

Builds a support vector machine classifier.
Fits the classifier to the training data.
Predicts the target variable for the test data.
Calculates and prints the accuracy score.
Prints the classification report.
Computes and prints the Matthews correlation coefficient.
Plots the ROC curve.
Naive Bayes:

Creates a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier.
Trains the classifier using the training data.
Predicts the target variable for the test data.
Calculates and prints the accuracy score.
Prints the Gaussian score.
Prints the classification report.
Computes and prints the Matthews correlation coefficient.
Plots the ROC curve.
Each algorithm's performance metrics and visualizations provide insights into their effectiveness for the given classification task.

The code assumes that the necessary libraries, such as sklearn and matplotlib, have been imported, and the data has been split into training and test sets (X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test).
